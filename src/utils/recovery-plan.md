4. **System-wide Testing and Optimization**
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Optimize performance across all modules
   - Ensure cross-browser and device compatibility

## Implementation Approach

### Module-by-Module Strategy

1. **Start with Navigation Framework**
   - This is the foundation that connects all modules
   - Fixing this first will make it easier to work on individual modules

2. **Focus on User Management Next**
   - This is a core module that other features depend on
   - Getting user and role management working will enable testing of permissions

3. **Then Address Widget Builder**
   - This is a highly visible feature for end users
   - Improvements here will demonstrate progress to stakeholders

4. **Finally Tackle AI Configuration**
   - This is the most complex module and depends on other parts working
   - By this point, the foundation will be stable enough to support it

### Development Process Improvements

1. **Implement Component Testing**
   - Create unit tests for all components
   - Add integration tests for module interactions
   - Establish pre-commit testing requirements

2. **Establish Code Review Standards**
   - Require peer review for all significant changes
   - Use a structured review checklist
   - Document component interfaces and behaviors

3. **Improve Project Management**
   - Break features into smaller, testable units
   - Implement regular progress tracking
   - Establish clear acceptance criteria for each feature

## Resource Requirements

1. **Development Resources**
   - 1-2 frontend developers focused on UI components and state management
   - 1 backend developer for API integration and data flow
   - 1 QA resource for testing and validation

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Establish a comprehensive test environment
   - Set up automated testing and deployment pipeline
   - Create documentation for component interfaces and APIs

3. **Management Support**
   - Regular progress reviews with stakeholders
   - Clear prioritization of features and fixes
   - Buffer time for unexpected issues

## Communication Plan

### For Management

1. **Initial Recovery Briefing**
   - Present current status assessment
   - Outline recovery strategy and timeline
   - Set expectations for progress reporting

2. **Weekly Progress Updates**
   - Provide status on completed tasks
   - Highlight upcoming milestones
   - Address any blockers or risks

3. **Phase Completion Reviews**
   - Demonstrate completed functionality
   - Gather feedback for adjustments
   - Confirm priorities for next phase

### For Development Team

1. **Daily Standups**
   - Focus on immediate tasks and blockers
   - Coordinate interdependent work
   - Share solutions and approaches

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - Document component interfaces
   - Create architectural diagrams
   - Establish coding standards and patterns

3. **Knowledge Sharing Sessions**
   - Review complex components together
   - Discuss architectural decisions
   - Share lessons learned

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Risk: Existing code may require significant refactoring
   - Mitigation: Allocate time for refactoring in each phase

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: New requirements may emerge during recovery
   - Mitigation: Strictly prioritize fixes over new features

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Fixed modules may not work together
   - Mitigation: Implement integration testing early

4. **Resource Constraints**
   - Risk: Limited developer availability may slow progress
   - Mitigation: Focus on critical path items first

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)**
   - Review and validate this recovery plan
   - Set up project tracking for recovery tasks
   - Begin work on navigation framework fixes

2. **Week 1 Focus**
   - Complete navigation framework repairs
   - Fix critical user management issues
   - Establish testing environment

3. **First Milestone (End of Week 2)**
   - Functional navigation between all main modules
   - Basic user management operations working
   - Initial fixes to widget builder preview

## Conclusion

While the project faces significant challenges, a structured approach to recovery can address the issues and get the project back on track. By focusing on stabilization first, then building out core functionality, and finally adding advanced features, we can methodically transform the current state into a robust, functional system that meets the original requirements.

The key to success will be disciplined execution of this plan, with regular communication, clear priorities, and a focus on quality at each step. With proper support and resources, the project can be recovered and completed successfully.
